## ðŸ§  Problem 1: Palindrome Linked List

**LeetCode Link**: [Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

### âœ… Problem Statement:
Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

### ðŸ’¡ Approach:
1. Use the slow and fast pointer method to find the middle of the list.
2. Reverse the second half of the list.
3. Compare the first and the reversed second half for palindrome property.
4. Return true if they match, else false.

### ðŸ§© Code: [`palindrome_linked_list.c`](./palindrome_linked_list.c)

### âœ… Problem Statement:
Determine if a given number is a perfect square without using the sqrt function.

### ðŸ’¡ Approach:
1. Use binary search between 1 and num/2.
2. At each step, calculate mid * mid and compare it with the number.
3. Return true if a match is found.
