🧮 Problem 1: Sign of the Product of an Array

LeetCode Link:
https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/description/
🔍 Problem Overview:

Given an integer array nums, return the sign of the product of all values in the array:

    1 if the product is positive,

    -1 if the product is negative,

    0 if the product is zero.

💡 Logic and Concept:

    The actual value of the product is not needed — just the sign.

    If any number is 0, the product is 0.

    If the count of negative numbers is even → result is 1, else -1.

    Track sign changes while iterating through the array.

🧠 Key Concepts:

    Sign Tracking

    Product Rules

    Efficient Iteration (O(n) Time)

🔗 Problem 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

LeetCode Link:
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/description/
🔍 Problem Overview:

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers — leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.
💡 Logic and Concept:

    Use a dummy node to handle edge cases where the head itself is a duplicate.

    Traverse the list using two pointers:

        current tracks duplicates.

        prev ensures the connection skips over all duplicates.

    Whenever a duplicate sequence is found (same value appearing consecutively), skip all of them in one go.

    This results in a clean list with only unique values retained.

🧠 Key Concepts:

    Linked List Traversal

    Dummy Node Pattern

    Duplicate Skipping Logic

    Two Pointer Technique
