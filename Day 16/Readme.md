## ðŸ§© Problem 1: Delete Node in a Linked List  
ðŸ”— **Problem Link**:  
https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/

### âœ… Problem Statement:
You are given a node in a singly linked list (not the tail). Your task is to delete that node from the list without access to the head pointer.

---

### ðŸ§  Logic Used:
Since we donâ€™t have access to the previous node, we canâ€™t perform traditional deletion.

Instead, we **copy the value from the next node into the current node**, and then **bypass the next node**.

Finally, we **free the memory** of the skipped node to avoid memory leaks.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Concepts Applied:
- Pointer manipulation in singly linked lists  
- In-place modification of data structures  
- Memory management in C  

---

### ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned:
- How to handle deletion when access is restricted.
- Clever use of overwriting to achieve deletion.
- Importance of freeing memory in C.

## ðŸ§© Problem 2: Sum of Square Numbers  
ðŸ”— **Problem Link**:  
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/description/

### âœ… Problem Statement:
Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine whether there exist two integers `a` and `b` such that:  
`aÂ² + bÂ² = c`

---

### ðŸ§  Logic Used:
- Applied a **two-pointer approach**:  
  Start with `a = 0` and `b = sqrt(c)`.
- If `aÂ² + bÂ² < c`, increment `a`.  
- If `aÂ² + bÂ² > c`, decrement `b`.  
- If equal, return `true`.

Used `long long` to prevent integer overflow.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Concepts Applied:
- Two-pointer technique  
- Math optimization using square root  
- Typecasting and overflow prevention  

---

### ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned:
- Mathematical strategies to improve brute-force approaches.
- How to prevent overflow in C with large calculations.
- Efficient searching through two-pointer logic.
