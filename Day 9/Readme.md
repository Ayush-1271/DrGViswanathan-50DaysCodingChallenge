## ✅ Problems Solved

### 1. [Nth Digit](https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-digit/)
- **Category**: Math
- **Difficulty**: Medium

#### 💡 Logic Used:
- The sequence is 123456789101112... and so on.
- We first identify the digit length of numbers containing the nth digit by subtracting the digit count per number range.
- Once the correct range is found, we calculate the exact number and extract the required digit using string operations.

#### 📘 Concepts Studied:
- Number systems and digit place values
- Mathematical modeling of number ranges
- Efficient calculation of digit positions without generating full sequences

### 2. [Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/)
- **Category**: Data Structures (Linked List)
- **Difficulty**: Medium

#### 💡 Logic Used:
- Traverse to find the k-th node from the start.
- Simultaneously, determine the k-th node from the end using a two-pointer approach.
- Swap the values of the two identified nodes.

#### 📘 Concepts Studied:
- Singly linked list traversal
- Two-pointer technique
- Swapping node values without changing node pointers
